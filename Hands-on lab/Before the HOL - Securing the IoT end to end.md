# Securing the IoT End to End before the hands-on lab setup guide 

## Requirements

    - Trial subscriptions will not work.

## Before the hands-on lab

Duration: 10 minutes

Synopsis: In this exercise, you will set up your environment for use in the rest of the hands-on lab. You should follow all the steps provided in the Before the Hands-on Lab section to prepare your environment *before* attending the workshop.

### Task 1: Download GitHub resources
