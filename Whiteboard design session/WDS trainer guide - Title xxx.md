# Trainer information

Thank you for taking time to support the whiteboard design sessions as a trainer!

## Role of the trainer

An amazing trainer:

-   Creates a safe environment in which learning can take place.

-   Stimulates the participant's thinking.

-   Involves the participant in the learning process.

-   Manages the learning process (on time, on topic, and adjusting to benefit participants).

-   Ensures individual participant accountability.

-   Ties it all together for the participant.

-   Provides insight and experience to the learning process.

-   Effectively leads the whiteboard design session discussion.

-   Monitors quality and appropriateness of participant deliverables.

-   Effectively leads the feedback process.

## Whiteboard design session flow 

Each whiteboard design session uses the following flow:

**Step 1: Review the customer case study (15 minutes)**

**Outcome**

Analyze your customer's needs.

-   Customer's background, situation, needs and technical requirements

-   Current customer infrastructure and architecture

-   Potential issues, objectives and blockers

**Step 2: Design a proof of concept solution (60 minutes)**

**Outcome**

Design a solution and prepare to present the solution to the target customer audience in a 15-minute chalk-talk format.

-   Determine your target customer audience.

-   Determine customer's business needs to address your solution.

-   Design and diagram your solution.

-   Prepare to present your solution.

**Step 3: Present the solution (30 minutes)**

**Outcome**

Present solution to your customer:

-   Present solution

-   Respond to customer objections

-   Receive feedback

**Wrap-up (15 minutes)**

-   Review preferred solution

## Before the whiteboard design session: How to prepare

Before conducting your first whiteboard design session:

-   Read the Student guide (including the case study) and Trainer guide.

-   Become familiar with all key points and activities.

-   Plan the point you want to stress, which questions you want to drive, transitions, and be ready to answer questions.

-   Prior to the whiteboard design session, discuss the case study to pick up more ideas.

-   Make notes for later.

## During the whiteboard design session: Tips for an effective whiteboard design session

**Refer to the Trainer guide** to stay on track and observe the timings.

**Do not expect to memorize every detail** of the whiteboard design session.

When participants are doing activities, you can **look ahead to refresh your memory**.

-   **Adjust activity and whiteboard design session pace** as needed to allow time for presenting, feedback, and sharing.

-   **Add examples, points, and stories** from your own experience. Think about stories you can share that help you make your points clearly and effectively.

-   **Consider creating a "parking lot"** to record issues or questions raised that are outside the scope of the whiteboard design session or can be answered later. Decide how you will address these issues, so you can acknowledge them without being derailed by them.

***Have fun**! Encourage participants to have fun and share!*

**Involve your participants.** Talk and share your knowledge but always involve your participants, even while you are the one speaking.

**Ask questions** and get them to share to fully involve your group in the learning process.

**Ask first**, whenever possible. Before launching into a topic, learn your audience's opinions about it and experiences with it. Asking first enables you to assess their level of knowledge and experience, and leaves them more open to what you are presenting.

**Wait for responses**. If you ask a question such as, "What's your experience with (fill in the blank)?" then wait. Do not be afraid of a little silence. If you leap into the silence, your participants will feel you are not serious about involving them and will become passive. Give participants a chance to think, and if no one answers, patiently ask again. You will usually get a response.

#  Securing the IoT end to end whiteboard design session student guide

## Abstract and learning objectives 

In this whiteboard design session, you will work with a group to design an end-to-end solution that leverages Microsoft Azure's IoT features, tools and resources to secure and monitor a set of IoT devices.

At the end of this session, you will be better able to design and recommend solutions that help organizations properly secure and monitor their IoT-based infrastructure.

## Step 1: Review the customer case study 

**Outcome**

Analyze your customer's needs.

Timeframe: 15 minutes

Directions:  With all participants in the session, the facilitator/SME presents an overview of the customer case study along with technical tips.

1.  Meet your table participants and trainer.

2.  Read all of the directions for steps 1-3 in the student guide.

3.  As a table team, review the following customer case study.

### Customer situation

Contoso, Ltd. has major holdings in one of the world’s most important oil-producing regions. To overcome the challenges of monitoring and optimizing a vast number of widely dispersed field assets, Contoso, Ltd. is looking to streamline its operations with IoT solutions. They want to deploy IoT technologies to electronically collect data and use cloud based solutions to store and analyze it in order to gain new insights into well operations and future drilling possibilities. 

Their environments are very tough environments in which to work. The climate is hot, harsh, and unforgiving, and oil wells are often spaced many miles apart, so field technicians can spend much of their day just driving from one to another. Cellular and radio reception is spotty at best, so collecting data about well conditions and performance typically involves manually writing down information. The technician must then make the long trek to the central office at the end of the day to upload the data for analysis. With such remote situations, a key concern for Contoso is not only how they manage these remote devices, but more broadly how they secure the complete solution that encompasses the physical device, the software on the device, the services processing the data in the cloud and the network connecting it all. 

Contoso plans to tie in to existing sensors at the well head that monitor key system parameters like temperatures, pressures, and flow rates. They will deploy gateway devices route device data for processing, storage and analytics. Internal IT staff and engineers want to visualize the high-resolution data and deliver near real-time analyses. The company is places a premium on flexibility and ease of use, with security as a fundamental. 

In addition, they would also like to the solution to yield benefits to their workers in the field. “The field technicians and lease operators already have tools on their phones that they use every day to see what a well is doing,” explains Miles Strom. “Our goal is to connect these tools to live data from the IoT sensors. So, instead of seeing low-resolution volumes or flow rates, they’ll see what is happening in real time. This way they can respond immediately to problems that lead to downtime or maintenance issues.”

They have implemented proof of concept solution for this collecting and analyzing device telemetry using IoT Hub, but are interested in learning about any related services in Azure that would help them to secure such solutions. 

### Customer needs 

1.  Ensure that all IoT devices are properly registered and assigned a secure tamperproof identity.

2.  Ensure devices are operating within assigned policy standards and are not tampered with.

3.  Enable an alerting solution with little to no effort configuration that will notify and allow for remediation in the case of fault or malicious activity.

4.  Ensure all events are surfaced in one place for simplicity.

5.  Address the need to have auditing and monitoring across a wide range of device operating systems and processor architectures (Linux, x86, x64, etc).

6.  Automate the security agent provisioning rather than having to physically or remotly "touch" all the devices.

7.  Ensure only the most secure protocols are implemented and used during any transmissions

8.  Ensure that in the future it will be possible to have an enterprise-wide look at any vulnerabilities or malicious events, not just specifically focused the IoT infrastructure.

### Customer objections 

1.  Contoso, Ltd staff are worried it may be impossible to manage the many thousands of IoT devices they have deployed around the world with any one product.

2.  Can Azure handle all the different types of operating systems and processor architectures of their devices?

3.  Will they be able to monitor for specific events on some of their propriatery devices?

4.  Can Azure support non-TPM hardware devices?

5.  Will the communications from a device to Azure be secure enough?

6.  Can an Azure logging solution handle the massive amount of events and alerts that will need to be ingested?

7.  Is it possible to assign role-based permissions based on their security objectives and policies to the IoT resources such as the Hub, Edge and individual devices? 

8.  Is the solution capable of being flexible in the types of reporting and alerts that can be generated based on custom logging event data?

9.  Will we be able to limit the messages and nework traffic to specific network IP addresses/subnets for our devices?
